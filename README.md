# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Project Requirements:

-   [x] Use the supplied mockup files and HTML snippets to guide you in building a Tic Tac Toe game. You can use jQuery or plain JavaScript to complete this project. Don't use an already programmed Tic Tac Toe plugin or library.
-   [x] When the page loads, the startup screen should appear.
-   [x] Add programming, so that when the player clicks the start button the start screen disappears, the board appears, and the game begins.
-   [x] Add the game play following these rules::
    -   Play alternates between X and O.
    -   The current player is indicated at the top of the page -- the box with the symbol O or X is highlighted for the current player.
    -   When the current player mouses over an empty square on the board, it's symbol the X or O should appear on the square.
    -   Players can only click on empty squares. When the player clicks on an empty square, attach the class box-filled-1 (for O) or box-filled-2 (for X) to the square.
    -   The game ends when one player has three of their symbols in a row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. If all of the squares are filled and no players have three in a row, the game is a tie.
-   [x] Add programming so that when the game ends, the board disappears and the game end screen appears:
    -   Show the word "Winner" or the phrase "It's a Tie!"
    -   Add the appropriate class to the ```<div> for the winning screen: <div class="screen screen-win" id="finish">``` screen-win-one for player 1, screen-win-two for player two, or screen-win-tie if the game ends with no winner. For example, if player 1 wins, the HTML should look like this: ```<div class="screen screen-win screen-win-one" id="finish">```
-   [x] Add programming so that when a player pushes the "New Game" button, the board appears again, empty, and a new game begins.
-   [x] Use the module pattern to wrap all of your JavaScript code into a single global variable or an immediately invoked function.

## Extra Credit:

-   [ ] On the start screen, prompt the user add their name before the game starts
-   [ ] Display the player’s name on the board screen during game play
-   [ ] Add programming to support playing against the computer. Only one player plays; the other is controlled by your programming.
-   [ ] Display the player’s name if they win the game
